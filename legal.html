Usage and user-related information, such as IP address, location, time or frequency of visits to our website, are transmitted to a Google server in the USA and stored there. However, we use Google Analytics with the so-called anonymization function. With this function, Google shortens the IP address within the EU or the EEA.

This data can also be used to provide other services related to the use of our website and the use of the Internet. Google states that your IP address will not be linked to other data.

The add-on notifies the JavaScript (ga.js) from Google Analytics that information about visiting our website should not be transmitted to Google Analytics.

The user is only forwarded to the service of the respective social network by clicking on the corresponding graphic. After the user has been forwarded, information about the user is recorded by the respective network. It cannot be ruled out that the data collected in this way will be processed in the USA. First of all, this includes data such as IP address, date, time and page visited. If the user is logged into his user account of the respective network, the network operator may be able to assign the information collected from the user&#x27;s specific visit to the user&#x27;s personal account. If the user interacts via a “share” button of the respective network, this information can be saved in the user&#x27;s personal user account and published if necessary. If the user wants to prevent the information collected from being directly assigned to his user account, he must log out before clicking on the graphic. It is also possible to configure the respective user account accordingly.<br><br>The following social networks are integrated into our website by linking:<br><br>- Facebook<br>Facebook Ireland Limited, 4 Grand Canal Square, Dublin 2, Ireland, a subsidiary of Facebook Inc., 1601 S.
